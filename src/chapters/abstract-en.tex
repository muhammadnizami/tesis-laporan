Despite non-expressive synthesis and performance being more popular for synth-pop and dance music, non-expressive performance is less preferrable in other genres such as classical music. There is not yet any CSEMP for string instrument that can produce expressive sound just from non-expressive musical sheet. Integration of existing strings CSEMP components cannot be done because of incompatibility of each component's input and output representations. In this work, a new system for synthesis and performance of string instruments is built, adopting neural parametric synthesis, a technique that was used previously for singing synthesis.
